# Assignment 1

This is **Haneen Al-musowi's** Git repository for Assignment One of the Web and Script Programming class.

This website demonstrates my abilities to apply basic concepts of **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. The project requirements included:

- A **Home Page**
- An **About Me Page** with an embedded video and photo
- A **Projects Page** using the class `box`
- A **Contact Me Page** using form elements

---

## Fluid Design

I incorporated fluidity into my website for different display sizes:

- **Laptop/PC:** 960 pixels and above  
- **Tablet:** 481 pixels â€“ 959 pixels  
- **Phone:** 480 pixels or less  

For each device view, I adjusted elements as needed:

- Made sizes relative using **percentages**  
- Changed colors for better contrast and readability on tablets and mobile devices  

---

## Gradients

I was asked to use **linear gradients** and **angle linear gradients** on the pages:

- **Linear gradients**: Applied to the body and wrapper of each page  
- **Angle linear gradients**: Applied to the footer of each page (except the home page) at **45 degrees**

## Color Scheme

My chosen palette focuses on soft pastel colors:

- Light Pink: `#FFB6C1`  
- Light Yellow: `#FAFAD2`  
- Light Blue: `#BDD2DF`  
- Contrast: Dark Slate Blue `#4E4690`  
- Additional soft purple: `#D7C7D3`  

For tablets and mobile devices, I replaced pink/blue gradients in the body and wrapper with **solid black** to increase contrast and readability.

## Testing and Validation

All testing and validation went according to plan and can be seen in the **verification PDF**.

## Notes

Most of the content follows the professor's tutorials and class examples.  

For the **JavaScript portions**, I referenced online resources to help create a function for verifying user input values on my form page. In particular, I used:
